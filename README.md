# ACT Generator: Test Oracle (Functional Simulator)

This repository contains the source code and documentation for `act-oracle`, a tool generator in the [ACT Ecosystem](https://github.com/act-compiler/act) that automatically generates test oracles (functional simulators) just from ISA specifications written in [TAIDL](https://act-compiler/taidl).

For more details about the ACT Ecosystem, refer to the top-level repository: [act-compiler/act](https://github.com/act-compiler/act).

## TAIDL: Tensor Accelerator ISA Definition Language

TAIDL is a domain-specific language designed to define instruction set architectures (ISAs) for tensor accelerators. It is published at [MICRO 2025](https://doi.org/10.1145/3725843.3756075)

## Test Oracle Generation

Details on automatically generating fast & scalable test oracles from TAIDL definitions is present in Section 5 of our [MICRO 2025](https://doi.org/10.1145/3725843.3756075).
